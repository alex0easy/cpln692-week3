    # Lab 1, Part 4 â€” Stretch Goal: Project Euler

    ## Introduction

    Practice your Javascript and math skills by solving a problem on Project
    Euler. Project Euler is a series of challenging math and computer science
    problems that can be solved using any language (for our class, use
    Javascript).

    Solve the first problem on this page https://projecteuler.net/archives
    (Multiples of 3 and 5). To check your answer, create an account and you will
    be able to submit your final result.

    If you complete problem 1, move on to problem 2!

    /* =====================

    Start code

    ===================== */
    // Question 1
    var answer1 = 0;

    for (let i=0; i<1000; i++){
      if (i%3===0 || i%5===0){answer1 = answer1 + i;};
    }

    console.log(answer1);

    // Question 2
    let i=1;
    let j=2;
    let k=i+j;
    let answer2=0;

    do {
      answer2=answer2+j;
      i=j+k;
      j=k+i;
      k=i+j;
    } while (j<4e6)
    console.log(answer2);
